Unit Timekeeping;

Interface

Uses
	SysUtils;

Const
	FPS_LIMIT = 120;
	TICKS_MINIMUM = 1000 div FPS_LIMIT;

// Used mainly during initialization,
// as the game switches to SDL-based timekeeping later.
Function GetTimeStamp(): TTimeStamp;
Function TimestampDiffMillis(Const First, Second: TTimeStamp): sInt;

// Get the current number of ticks.
// This number will stay constant until the next call to GetDeltaTime().
Function GetTicks(): uInt;

// Advance the time and report the number of ticks passed.
// This will ensure that at least TICKS_MINIMUM milliseconds have passed since the previous call.
Function AdvanceTime(): uInt;


Implementation

Uses
	SDL2;

Var
	Ticks: uInt;

Function AdvanceTime(): uInt;
Var
	NewTicks: uInt;
Begin
	While True do begin
		NewTicks := SDL_GetTicks();
		If((NewTicks - Ticks) >= TICKS_MINIMUM) then Break;
		SDL_Delay(1)
	end;
	
	Result := NewTicks - Ticks;
	Ticks := NewTicks
End;

Function GetTicks(): uInt;
Begin
	Result := Ticks
End;

Function GetTimeStamp(): TTimeStamp;
Begin
	Result := DateTimeToTimeStamp(Now())
End;

Function TimestampDiffMillis(Const First, Second: TTimeStamp): sInt;
Var
	Diff: Comp;
Begin
	Diff := TimeStampToMSecs(Second) - TimeStampToMSecs(First);
	{$IFDEF CPUI386}
		(*
		 * On i386, the Comp type cannot be cast to an sInt, resulting in a compilation error.
		 * As a (rather dirty) workaround, force a cast to a floating-point value and then cast back to integer.
		 *)
		Result := Trunc(Extended(Diff))
	{$ELSE}
		Result := sInt(Diff)
	{$ENDIF}
End;

Initialization
	Ticks := 0;

End.
