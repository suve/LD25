POST-COMPO VERSION

-----===== About =====-----
Colorful tells the story of a man, struggling to bear with the depression
of his beloved woman. No longer able to cope with it, he goes on a quest
to make her world, once again... colorful.

Based heavily on Hero Core, Colorful is a game where the player
moves freely around a 2D world, fighting multiple enemies. The
goal is to collect eight colour artifact. Every artifact brought
back to yor love makes you slightly stronger, so if you get stuck,
it may be wiser to try visiting another colour zone and coming back
later.

On your way you will often meet closed doors. These are always tied to
enemies, most often energy generators - but sometimes also turrents,
or maybe even that one unsignificant drone in the corner. Defeating said
enemy will unlock the door. Note that many door-unlocking enemies will
spawn even after the door have been unlocked.

But fear not - dying will only cause you to go back to the starting room.
All doors remain unlocked. You will, however, drop any colour artifacts
you were carrying at the moment - so make sure to give them to your woman
after you pick up one!

Since v.1.1, the game does posesss a save feature. The game is saved
automatically upon delivering one of the colour artifacts or on death.
Game is also saved upon starting or loading a game using different gameworld
or closing the program.
