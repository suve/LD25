= 2017.0723 =
* The woman will now cycle through colours at a fixed rate, instead of
  randomly picking a colour each frame.
* Cropped the game font to remove unused space.

= 2017.0721 =
+ The game will now listen to events when loading assets (it will not freeze
  and will respond properly to a "quit" request).

= 2017.0707 =
* If the game is compiled using FPC 3.0.0 or newer, it will include ("uses")
  the compiler-provided version of SDL_Mixer, instead of the bundled one.

= 2017.0630 =
+ It is now possible to use the mouse to select options in the menus.
+ The mouse cursor is now hidden upon entering the game (and shown again when
  going back to the menu).

= 2017.0629 =
+ The game now properly loads and sets its window icon.
* Made the green zone a little bit harder (added a door that forces the player
  to take a longer way to a generator).

= 2017.0628 =
* Moved room change so it doesn't take place during the game step.
* Changed the way hero-room collisions are handled - should improve
  the room-change experience.
* Minor fixes to maps.

= 2017.0627 =
* Moved game loop code to a separate code file.

= 2017.0326 =
* Fixed possible segfault in TRoom.Collides() and TRoom.HitSfx().

= 2014.0316 =
* Fixed a bug which made an SDL_Mixer call before the library was initialized.
  Which, quite amusingly, led to division by zero and crash on some machines,
  and worked perfectly fine on others.
> v.1.2 released, after sitting on my HDD for over a year.

= 2013.0108 =
* Replaced BASS with SDL_Mixer for audio handling.
* Moved finalization from main() to QuitProg().

> v.1.1 realeased.

= 2012.1225 =
+ Implemented the keybinding dialog.
+ Added a global shutdown variable.
* All enemy behaviour times have been changed from consts to object fields,
  with their values slightly randomized upon object creation.
+ Implemented the gameworld selection dialog.
* Instead of separate main menu entries, the player is presented with
  gameworld selection dialog when (s)he wishes to begin/load a game.
> Finished the tutorial.

= 2012.1224 =
+ Added automatic pause upon losing application focus.
+ Added automatic savegame upon death, progress (delivering a colour)
  and program exit.
* Moved ChangeRoom() and DestoryEntities() to shared.
* Separate savegames for every gameworld.

= 2012.1223 =
+ Added the configfiles unit.
+ Added some comments in case anyone would actually want to read the code.
* Divided tutorial and game maps into subfolders.
* "tile" roomscript command now takes (1,1)-(20,20) coords,
  instead of (0,0)-(19,19).

= 2012.1222 =
* Fixed loading sounds not updating the progress bar.
* Moved room loading from rooms/initialization to shared/interface/LoadRes().
+ Added the floatingtext unit.
* Changed the main menu a bit and into/outro programming.
+ Added volume setting and volume UI display.
+ Added pause feature.
+ Added window resizing ability.
* Fixed Basher's programming.
  (When going down, used to bounce off left, instead of up.)
+ Woman is now randomly displayed in one of central palette's colours.
+ Hero has a 1/5 chance to be drawn with the colour
  of the currently held artifact.
+ Added four new tile types.
* Some changes in game maps.
